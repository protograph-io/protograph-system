# ProtoGraph

Authors: Anonymized

*Abstract: Creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing visualizations and animations of small-to-moderate sized graphs is a common task across fields, particularly in pedagogical settings. Unfortunately, this task often requires constructing a graph by hand, learning a specific tool set, or programming language to create the visualization. This slows the prototyping process, and adds a barrier for many non-programmers. To address this problem, we present ProtoGraph, a language for rapidly specifying static and dynamic graph visualizations. The language focuses on being easy to learn and efficient to use, while also being extensible to enable new commands to be integrated. We also deliver a TypeScript/JavaScript graph visualization library for rendering the language and a web-based graphical interface that integrates the language and visualization library for rapid prototyping of graphs and graph animations. We performed a user study to investigate the usability of ProtoGraph with both programmers and non-programmers.*



ProtoGraph is an extensible graph (node-link) visualization and animation system.
